# Orientation-System-for-a-Mobile-Manipulator-to-be-Utilized-in-Microgravity-Applications
This system can be utilized for space mobile manipulators to execute 2 orientation motions. 
This repository includes Unity Project Files&amp;Execution Files, Solidworks part files, Matlab codes.

Parallel to the increase in outer space operations, studies that try to implement robotic systems into
applications executed in microgravity environment gains popularity in near era. Due to the limited
human resources and challenging environments in outer space, various robot manipulators have been
designed to accomplish both collaborative tasks and autonomous tasks along with the humans. On the
other hand, there still exist many challenges in the field waiting to be solved. One of these can be given
as providing locomotion to the mobile robotic systems that will be utilized in microgravity environment
as the task is totally different from conventional approaches taken in land or air operations. In light of
this, current study tries to propose an orientation system that can be implemented on a mobile
manipulator to provide rotational locomotion. The system mainly utilizes a rotating flying wheel and
two degrees of freedom spherical parallel manipulator to implement conservation of angular
momentum to the given locomotion task.
